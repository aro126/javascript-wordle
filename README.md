# Wordle JavaScript Remake

This project was based on [this tutorial](https://www.codingnepalweb.com/word-guessing-game-html-css-javascript/) by Coding Nepal which I adapted to recreate Wordle in JavaScript.

### View site live

You can view this game live at [this link](https://aro126.github.io/javascript-wordle/) hosted on GitHub.

### Not optimized for mobile viewing

If viewed on a mobile device, the site layout will not adapt, and if the device has text suggestions turned on, this will interfere with event handling when Backspace key is pressed. The device will clear all previously typed text from the suggestions before the player can clear their guesses on the webpage.
